What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You initiate tracking changes with Git. There is no intial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging can include files from the working directory on deck for
commit. Repository would then be tracking changes to those files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit 
per logical change?

Only stage files that contain changes related to that logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
your history organized? How would branches help?

If you want to keep a certain version of the project, but then use
another version to play around with or create a slightly different
version; you can easily switch between versions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

You can see the trail of commits for each branch, as well as branchless
commits which do not have a parent branch. You have the option to
create a branch for these commits if you want to be able to track them.
