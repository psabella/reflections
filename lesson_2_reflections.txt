What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You initiate tracking changes with Git. There is no intial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging can include files from the working directory on deck for
commit. Repository would then be tracking changes to those files.
