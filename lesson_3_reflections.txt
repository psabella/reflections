When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

You may want to share your work, or give multiple contributers access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

That may get really confusing if the code is constantly
changing. It's easier to work on one unit of code before
updating everything - easier for collaboration on
different parts of the project.
