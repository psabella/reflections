When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

You may want to share your work, or give multiple contributers access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

That may get really confusing if the code is constantly
changing. It's easier to work on one unit of code before
updating everything - easier for collaboration on
different parts of the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is when you want to copy someone else's GitHub
repository to your GitHub. Clone is when you want to
copy a repository from GitHub to your local machine, 
or copy a repository from local to local. Branch would
be creating a branch within the repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state 
of the remote stored locally?

You can see all the most recent changes offline while you still work 
on your local copy. Then when you are ready you can merge remote with
local.
